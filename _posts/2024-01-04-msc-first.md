## I. Introduction

Before completing my BSc, I thought, "I'll never pursue a master's.". The primary reason was that most of the IT-related university courses seemed outdated and/or didn't align with my interests. On the day of my final exam, I had this feeling again, questioning why I would write another thesis if I don't plan to pursue a Ph.D. I believed I should work, gain experience, and that's it (for context, in the last semester of my BSc, I started working full-time for Starschema). However, the deadline for applying to the MSc in Hungary was before my final exam, so my PTSD hadn't fully developed due to the pending exam (just jokin'). I initially wanted to work full-time, so part-time courses seemed to be my only option. The first choice was the Computer Science MSc at the University of Szeged. However, on the last day, I discovered new Data Science-related programs in Hungary.

There were two options. The first one is in Debrecen (University of Debrecen) or in Veszprém (University of Pannonia). After checking the curricula of the two programs, I liked the one in Veszprém more. So I applied and waited until the deadline, which was around the end of July. Meanwhile, there was an interview with the board of the degree. We discussed why I wanted to apply, my motivations, what I do in my free time related to the course, etc. It was a valuable experience, providing me with the opportunity to meet the faculty and gain insights into the significance of this new degree for the university.

Surprisingly (not really), I got accepted. So, this is why I can write this article.

## II. Dive into the classes

So registration is done. We have arrived to the first semester. The recording of the subject were relatively easy, the Neptun system (surprisingly) was not frozen. I took all the available classes for the first semester. There were 4 mandatory classes:
- Mathematical Statistics
- Data Visualization and BI Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- Supervised Machine Learning

And 3 optional classes:
- Advanced Operation Research
- Artificial Intelligence Lab
- Python Programming

The semester was divided into two parts. In the first 7 weeks were the Statistics, AI, Supervised and Python classes. From the 10th week until the end of the semester (the semester was 15 weeks long) the other classes. From all of the 15 weeks we have to travel down to Veszprém only 5 times, which I think is sustainable.

In the following part I'll briefly talk about each subject and share my experiences.

### Mathematical Statistics:
In this class, we progressed from the basics of statistics to more complex hypothesis testing. Personally, I found the lessons to be somewhat dry, but university-level statistics tends to be that way. In my opinion, it was the most challenging class of the entire semester -perhaps even the entire degree (we'll see how I feel in three semesters)-.

Each lesson was divided into two parts. The first 60-70% focused on theory, followed by practical implementation with R if time allowed. However, there was a sense that the theory held more importance (understandable for a Data Science degree).

The final exam, surprisingly, wasn't as difficult as expected. The first part consisted entirely of theory, followed by a set of problems to solve using R. With more efficient studying, I believe I could have achieved a better grade.

<b>Final Grade: 2</b>

### Artificial Intelligence:
This subject was likely one of my favorites of the semester, so I might be a bit biased. We covered the first five [lectures of David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-), supplemented with deep learning. Despite the course title suggesting a broader focus on Artificial Intelligence, it primarily delved into Reinforcement Learning.

Starting with Markov Processes, we gradually built the necessary knowledge to understand fundamental RL algorithms such as the Monte Carlo method, Q-Learning, etc. The course also covered dynamic programming, model-free prediction, and model-free control. It provided a great opportunity to gain insights into the field of reinforcement learning and offered materials for those interested in a deeper understanding.

The exam was oral, involving a discussion with the professor about various topics in the curriculum.

<b>Final Grade: 5</b>

### Supervised Learning:
In this class, we delved into what many consider the essence of "data science." We began by understanding how data is stored and processed to build machine learning models. The emphasis of this class was predominantly technical. While theory was covered, it was integral for truly grasping how these models operate, highlighting the importance of correlation testing, and emphasizing the necessity of data preparation for specific models.

To earn a signature for the class, we were tasked with creating a project. Using a dataset, we explored various classification and/or regression models, engaging in data preprocessing. Following model creation, we then delved into hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. The culmination of the course involved an oral exam covering different topics from the entire curriculum.

<b>Final Grade: 5</b>

### Python Programming:

I won't delve extensively into this class as it covers the basics of Python, Pandas, and some plotting. It's an excellent course for absolute beginners or those unfamiliar with programming. However, if you regularly use the language, completing this course won't be challenging. There were two smaller exams and three homework assignments. The homeworks were necessary to obtain a signature, and the combined points of the exams determined the final grade.

<b>Final Grade: 5</b>

### Data Visualization and BI Systems:

In this class, we explored two BI systems:

1. IBM Cognos
2. Microsoft PowerBI

Additionally, we utilized Matplotlib with Python to tackle visualization exercises. The course covered the fundamentals of both BI systems, including importing and transforming data, adding new columns, and creating various charts and elements for dashboards. The emphasis was on practical application, making it a hands-on experience.

Towards the end, we undertook a comprehensive exam lasting 2 hours and 15 minutes. The exam required solving exercise sheets in PowerBI or Cognos (clearly, I opted for PowerBI because, well, I'm not a fan of Cognos), and for bonus points, there was a Python plotting exercise sheet.

<b>Final Grade: 5</b>

### Artificial Intelligence Lab:

True to its name, this course served as the lab component of the mandatory AI class, surprisingly, this one wasn't mandatory. In the first lesson, we implemented basic RL algorithms. Unfortunately, with only two sessions (more hours in the curriculum would have been appreciated), the second and last ones focused on Large Language Models (LLMs). We leveraged the ChatGPT API to create specific models tailored to predefined tasks and assessed the limitations of these models.

To earn a grade, we were tasked with creating a project that implemented either an RL algorithm or utilized an LLM for a practical purpose. Opting for the RL aspect, I implemented Mountain Car from [OpenAI Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/mountain_car_continuous/), achieving "medior" results with Q Learning. While I believe there's room for improvement with advanced algorithms like Deep Q Learning, it was a fascinating exploration.

<b>Final Grade: 5</b>

### Advanced Operations Research:

Interestingly, this class concluded as the last one, although it wasn't intentionally organized in chronological order. Surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the most unexpected highlights of the semester. Having previously studied operations research during my BSc and enjoying it, I initially thought, "Okay, I know this; it's easy." However, as we delved into more advanced and broader theories. Unfortunately, conducting these lessons online didn't live up to the expected advantages.

We covered a range of advanced operations research concepts, including the general simplex algorithm, sensitivity testing, Integer Programming (IP), transportation problems, and duality. The exam posed a challenge, primarily due to time constraints. With six problems, I found myself rushing, completely finishing only three of the first five, leaving me unable to start the last exercise. To secure a good grade, one needed to have a comprehensive understanding of all types of problems and their solutions in their head.

<b>Final Grade: 4</b>

## III. Lessons from this Semester:
It was a great choice to pursue a full-time job and a part-time master's. It's fantastic that I can delve into more theory, but working and gaining real-life experience is more beneficial. Of course, it has its challenges, but if I can set my priorities, then it can work. I hope that in the future, I can apply the gained knowledge to my real projects. However, if I don't directly apply the gained knowledge, it helps me view things from a different perspective.

One beneficial aspect is that I could meet others from different fields, and it's genuinely great that I can make new connections. One thing I don't know is whether online classes are an advantage or not. I mean, it's great that I don't have to travel to Veszprém every weekend, but on the other hand, it's much harder for me to focus for 6-8 hours on a class with small breaks. I know everyone has different preferences, and it's much harder for teachers to keep attention on themselves. I think they are working on solving this problem as well.

So, I'm curious about how things will go in the next semester. More online or offline classes? I don't know. But soon, I have to think about my thesis as well.
